# Sentiment Analysis of Airline Tweets

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on airline tweets using machine learning techniques. The analysis categorizes customer feedback into positive and negative sentiments. This allows airlines to understand customer experiences and improve their services based on real-time feedback.

### Key Highlights:
- Implemented **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Multi-Layer Neural Network (MLNN)** classifiers.
- **Preprocessed text data** with tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization.
- Developed **visualizations** to highlight top words for positive and negative sentiments.
- Achieved **SVM accuracy of 79%** and **MLNN accuracy of 76%**.
- Designed a **webpage interface** to display results interactively.

## Features
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenization and cleaning of tweets.
   - Stopword removal using NLTK's stopwords.
   - Text vectorization using the TF-IDF approach.
2. **Model Training and Comparison:**
   - Trained two models: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-Layer Neural Network (MLNN).
   - Compared model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores.
3. **Visualization:**
   - Bar graphs of most frequent words in positive and negative tweets.
   - A graphical comparison of SVM and MLNN performance.
4. **Webpage Integration:**
   - Display results, including graphs, in an accessible and interactive HTML webpage.
